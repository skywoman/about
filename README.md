# About Skywoman
We're a group of engineers, designers and farmers making better tools to feed people. [Skywoman](https://www.patreon.com/skywoman) made us.

We are currently holding monthly virtual gatherings on the first Sunday of each month:. 

- __Free Play, 12pm - 3pm EST__: Some unstructured time to nerd out on ongoing projects, collaborate, plan, kibitz, or work independently. We can get into the weeds on engineering, development and design topics, but people of all professional backgrounds are welcome to join, ask questions or simply observe. We will meet in the [Discord General Voice Channel](https://discord.gg/SSh2gCbK) (a Patreon membership is required). Drop in any time!
- __Roundtable, 3pm - 4pm EST__: For both farmers and techies to report on recent progress and activities, submit feedback/requests, and flag action items for follow-up. Techies are encouraged to keep the jargon to a minimum, farmers to point out all the stuff we're overlooking (with kindness). Open to the public; join at https://meet.jit.si/skywoman-pod-mustella.

## Get involved
