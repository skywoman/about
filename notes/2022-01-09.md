# Playdate!
## Synopsis
...as best as I can recall:

- Played around with [ideal-adventure](https://github.com/skywoman/ideal-adventure) and [netlify-serverless-test](https://github.com/skywoman/netlify-serverless-test) repositories.
- Went around giving a recap of our skills and interests.
- Demo of ideal-adventure by Rhys.
- Forked [`eddie`](https://github.com/cnative100/eddie) to the skywoman org.
- Created a `notes` repo, which I later renamed `about`, so it can double as an public intro to what we're doing here.
- Discussed OAuth, token management, context switching, overall project aims.
- Started a [kanban project](https://github.com/orgs/skywoman/projects/1) for the GH Org, so we can track projects and opportunities.

There's a lot more details in that kanban. If others have notes they'd like to include, feel free to open a PR!
