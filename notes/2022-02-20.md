## Notes

- Intros
- Janice
  - maybe recap the purpose behind this survey?
- Nate
  - can work on putting the survey into a Google Form later to optimize group time
- Melissa
  - general consensus that producers are struggling with software solutions
  - everything from CRM to ERP
  - good tech solutions can multiply farm's efforts
  - survey goes out to all farmers in group to find out
    - what are pain points?
- Jamie
  - also include 
- Janice
  - incentive: if it becomes a directory for everyone to use
  - making the survey seem "doable" and "worth the 5 minutes"
- Rhys
  - make it possible for people to give as much or little info
  - also, "Show us your spreadsheets!" sessions
- Nate
  - use questionnaire to generate initial directory, and to schedule followups for more in-depth convos and possible "show your spreadsheets!" sessions
- m
  - grant for discovering what are the top pain points
  - produce an MVP solution
  - provide tech assistance
  - voluteers to help find the $'s
- Rhys
  - in getting to the 
- Nate
  - seems to be an opportunity to take some of this stuff and connect people with existing solutions or identify where there is NOT an existing solution
- Melissa
  - unique about this group is the food sovereignty lens
  - other software solutions are set up to work best in a hierarchical model, not so much horizontal
- Janice
  - knowing how to describe different types of orgs, eg:
    - make sure to add seaweed to the list with pork, carrots, etc
    - what is a realistic idea of total revenue? $100? $1M?
- Nate
  - feel like there's a danger of catering strongly to existing farms
  - ones that are thriving with their own brand might not be willing to migrate beyond that brand
- Melissa
  - is there a super-power service already out there that we could get into everyone's hands?
  - like get Non-profit salesforce for everyone?
- Jamie
  - keep in mind the possibility of small groups of devs working with small groups of farmers to develop a small plugin or module etc
- review of general terminology (producer, operation, etc)
- reviewing products to include
