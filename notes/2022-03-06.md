# March roundtable

## Survey
https://airtable.com/shra56uPWkfhccc4e

- 
- Nate presents the survey
- may be good to present it at state of small farming


## Ideal Adventure
https://github.com/somethingelse-skywoman/ideal-adventure

- Rhys
  - draw out the potential of the site
  - got db together
  - Square's working, tokens etc
  - Skeleton of the site
  - But what's the site going to do?
- David
  - Who is the user this is for?
- Rhys
  - right now the features are
  - lots of 3rd party services, but all free tiers
  - Planet Scale for databases (managed, scaleable MySQL)
  - waiting on more survey feedback to decide what to do
  - maybe have a systems diagram to move forward
- David
  - are there ways that pod members can support you (Rhys)?
- Rhys
  - a little worried about going to far w/o input, eg, maybe people don't like JS, maybe don't like SQL, etc
- Mohammed
  - are we doing a site, are we doing a platform, a protocol, etc?
  - are we still trying to tackle that first problem that Chris posed?
- Rhys
  - still open to seeing where this can go
- Janice
  - from my understanding Chris had a very concrete problem
  - sounds like Ideal Adventure could do many things
  - Chris's use case is "ready to go"
  - can someone explain Chris's use case again?
- David
  - pull orders from square
  - generating a picklist to pull those orders out of inventory
  - send that picklist off to Fleet service
  - we've also got a chicken-n-egg problem though
- Mohammed
  - is it worth discussing the architecture we're trying to build looks like?
- David
  - seems as though we don't know enough to have a good perspective on arch
- Evan
  - Janice and I were talking, and if you're building something go for it
  - also good to swap stories in terms of use cases
  - could probably resolve some of this stuff with a Zapier solution
  - looking for drama in things
  - how many web apps can we build for what's not a huge market?
  - context around end-user is important
  - Janice's experience w/ CPG could be really helpful to understand people who are a certain size
- Rhys
  - is there a way to help people connect locally, and can we give them reason to?
  - there are system changes that will be required for most of this software to work
